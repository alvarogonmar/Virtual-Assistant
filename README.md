By [@alvarogonmar](https://github.com/alvarogonmar)


**Susan** is a Python-based virtual assistant designed to simplify your daily tasks. Whether you want to check the weather, play your favorite songs on YouTube, search the web, or just hear a joke, Susan is here to help. It integrates voice recognition, web search, and various APIs to offer an intuitive and responsive experience.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Listens and responds to voice commands using `SpeechRecognition`.
- **Voice Output**: Speaks back to the user with natural-sounding voice via `pyttsx3`.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Fetches and tells you the current weather in any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Web Integration**: Opens YouTube, Google, Netflix, and Max (HBO Max) with simple voice commands.
- **Music and Videos**: Plays songs or videos on YouTube using `pywhatkit`.
- **Jokes**: Lighten your mood with a random joke fetched from `pyjokes`.
- **Time and Date**: Provides current time and date information.
- **Wikipedia Search**: Retrieves quick summaries from Wikipedia for any search query.
- **Internet Search**: Searches the web using `pywhatkit`.
